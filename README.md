<h1 align='center'> Playground</h1>
<p align='center'>
In India, more than 95% of schools don't allow smartphones in class. Being a Computer Science teacher becomes very difficult as it is nearly impossible to check the handwritten code of each student line by line. Also talking in India, in most schools, the students don't have the privilege to have one computer each for them so that they can run their code on their own. So it becomes a nightmare for the teacher as they might have to manually type each code of each student and run it or take the risk of missing out on bugs. So we came up with Playground to make this job easier. Another reason for creating Playground was that once we entered college we understood the importance of coding. Coding not only helps you in a Software job but also helps increase logical reasoning and problem-solving ability. But many students don't have the chance of coding till they reach college. Why? Because there are so many students in India who can not afford a laptop or computer. So we decided to build a progressive web app because in today's world almost everyone uses a phone. Now they can start coding early and learn from online teachers. <br/> <br/>
In addition to that, we conducted a survey among our teachers where we found that teachers give more than 40% of their time to creating questions for various class tests, assignments and exams. So this teacher's day, we wanted to help them out. For this, we came up with crowdsourcing question bank idea. Anyone across the world can now help teachers make questions. <br/> <strong>By everyone, for teachers!‚ù§</strong>

## üìå Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

From your command line, first clone this repo:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sayande2002/JSR_Online_Test

# Go into the repository
$ cd JSR_Online_Test

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server.

Thanks!
